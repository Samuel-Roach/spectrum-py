Spectrum-py is a lightweight program written to help you easily produce spectrums for any video on YouTube. Inspired by r/DataIsBeautiful, Spectrum-py was created as a solo project to fill the gap found by the abscense of any easy-to-use and free spectrum creator. Originally designed to just produce spectrums, the plan is to expand to allow more analysis of the colours within the frames of videos.

##What is a spectrum
A spectrum is an image created from averaging the colour of every frame in a video, and putting them next to each other. The idea is to create a global view of the dominant colours throughout a video.
